# Binaries and Scripts

A collection of all code that is reused in the workflow.

Ideally, only this code is referenced in the workflow, either by calling it via a relative path (e.g., "python3 ../../example.py") or by creating symbolic links to the scripts (this might be fragile!).
This way, updates to any of the code will be immediately distributed to all subfolders.
